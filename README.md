<br><br>
This is my (personal) project I've been working on recently.<br>
You are welcome to push commits.
<br><br>
Yes, I know the structs are Neonite++.<br>
But, it's a personal project and I wanted to test some stuff.
<br><br>

## How to use

Fake anticheats and inject!<br>
<br>
How to get "server side maps" (it's just client sided collision with streammap): <br>
Open console, type "streammap (any umap)". Now go to Debug and click "FORCE". Now you will have client side collision.<br>
You can do much more with this "FORCE", it gives you "Net Authority" and it's really useful.<br>
To go back to without priority, click "Autonomous Proxy".<br>
With net authority you can also do these things client sided, Teleport, BugItGo, and more!<br>
<br>
WallHacks (ish): streammap Apollo_Terrain while in a solo or whatever. It'll remove all terrain but entities (due to obvious reasons).

## Features

CheatManager and Console.<br>
ImGui Menu.<br>
cURL and ProcessEvent Hook.<br>

## Keybinds

F8 - ImGui Menu

## Todo

Stop using patterns and use FindString.<br>
Clean and improve code.<br>
Get skins/character parts, emotes all working client side.<br>
Eventually wraps server side (ServerApplyOverrideWrapToItem).<br>
